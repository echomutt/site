<h1 id="termsofservice" style="text-align: center;">terms of service</h1>

<p><strong>I reserve the right to end a live session immediately if my limits or boundaries are ignored</strong>, without a refund. Therefore, 
please read my limits carefully and ask questions if unsure.</p>

<p><strong>I will check for legal ID before doing anything else</strong>, with all information redacted except for your age. I will provide a 
picture of my ID to verify that I am an adult as well. I have absolutely zero tolerance for minors contacting me or 
requesting content.</p>

<p><strong>Messaging me before making a purchase is a <em>requirement</em>, especially for custom content.</strong> 
If money is sent to me without discussion of what you are purchasing, I will treat it as a tip, with no refund. 
If we do discuss, agree, and you make a purchase, but I am unable to complete your request due to extenuating circumstances, I will refund you.
Please have flexibility with time frames for delivering content; they will be discussed on a per-item basis, but refunds or partial refunds will 
not be given on a late item unless it is more than 2 weeks late or I become unable to complete the request.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read! I look forward to chatting :3</p>
