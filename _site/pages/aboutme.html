<h2 style="text-align: center;">hi! i'm echo muttplug &lt;3</h2>

<h2 id="my-dom-style">my dom style</h2>

<p>I hold so much affection for my subs, as my most precious playthings, and I’m not afraid to express it through 
praise and adoration. That does not mean I don’t give out mean punishments, or even punishments as a treat, 
and I always expect a thank-you for them. I love masochistic subs who submit like second nature, and who worship me 
even as I torture them for my own pleasure. I’m also more than happy to slather on the praise for a soft 
session. Of course, I love making fun and sexy custom content to your liking, either making instructions for 
my wonderful subs or filming myself; I always cum hardest on camera. I also love rating cocks, to humiliate 
or to worship, or even just to give my starkly honest opinion; it’s 
really fun for me. And finally, in my sexting, I’m particularly skilled at crafting erotic stories of 
pleasure, pain, fantasy, and erotic tension, incorporating many different kinks and then roleplaying them with 
you. I can be quite creative ;)</p>
